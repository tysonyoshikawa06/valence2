# Defining Matter

---

## What is Matter?

**Matter** is anything that has **mass** and takes up **space**.  
If you can weigh it and it occupies volume, it is matter.

A simple analogy: imagine filling a backpack. Books, water bottles, and clothes all add weight and take up room—those are matter. Light and sound do not add weight or volume, so they are _not_ matter.

In chemistry, defining matter correctly is essential because it allows us to classify substances based on **composition**, which determines their **properties and behavior**.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Pure Substances vs. Mixtures

Matter is classified into two broad categories:

- **Pure substances** → fixed composition
- **Mixtures** → variable composition

This distinction is based entirely on **what particles are present and how they are combined**.

---

### 2. Elemental Composition of Pure Substances

A **pure substance** has a **constant and uniform composition** and cannot be separated by physical means.

There are two types of pure substances:

#### Elements

- Made of **one type of atom**
- Cannot be broken down chemically
- Defined by atomic number

Examples:

- Oxygen (O₂)
- Gold (Au)
- Carbon (C)

> Elements are the fundamental building blocks of all matter.

#### Compounds

- Made of **two or more elements chemically bonded**
- Always have the same ratio of atoms
- Can be broken down **chemically**, not physically

Examples:

- Water (H₂O)
- Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
- Sodium chloride (NaCl)

> The elemental composition of a compound is fixed and determines its chemical properties.

---

### 3. Composition of Mixtures

A **mixture** contains two or more substances that are **physically combined**, not chemically bonded.

Key features:

- Variable composition
- Components retain their individual properties
- Can be separated by **physical methods**

There are two types of mixtures:

#### Homogeneous Mixtures (Solutions)

- Uniform composition throughout
- Single visible phase

Examples:

- Saltwater (aq)
- Air (g)
- Vinegar (aq)

> Solutions have constant appearance but variable composition.

#### Heterogeneous Mixtures

- Non-uniform composition
- Multiple visible phases

Examples:

- Sand and water
- Oil and water
- Granite

## Formulas & Calculations

### Percent Composition (for Compounds)

Percent composition describes the **mass percent** of each element in a compound.

$$
\%\ \text{element} = \frac{\text{mass of element}}{\text{total mass of compound}} \times 100
$$

This reinforces that compounds have **fixed elemental composition**.

## Examples

### Example 1: Identifying Type of Matter

Classify each as an element, compound, or mixture.

- O₂ → **Element**
- H₂O → **Compound**
- Air → **Homogeneous mixture**
- Salad → **Heterogeneous mixture**

✔ Classification depends on **composition**, not appearance.

---

### Example 2: Elemental Composition of a Pure Substance

Water (H₂O) always contains:

- 2 hydrogen atoms
- 1 oxygen atom

Regardless of sample size:

- 18 g of H₂O
- 180 g of H₂O

The **ratio of elements remains constant**.

> This is why H₂O is a pure substance, not a mixture.

---

### Example 3: Variable Composition of a Mixture

Saltwater can be made with:

- 5 g NaCl in 100 g H₂O
- 20 g NaCl in 100 g H₂O

Both are saltwater, but their compositions differ.

✔ This variability confirms saltwater is a **mixture**, not a compound.

## Why It Matters

Defining matter correctly allows chemists to:

- Predict **physical and chemical properties**
- Separate mixtures efficiently
- Identify substances experimentally
- Apply conservation of mass
- Understand reactions at the particle level

This classification system is the foundation for:

- Stoichiometry
- Chemical reactions
- Solutions and equilibria
- Analytical chemistry

---

## Common Mistakes

- Thinking compounds can be separated physically
- Assuming all uniform materials are pure substances
- Confusing elements with compounds
- Believing mixtures have fixed ratios
- Classifying based on appearance instead of composition

---

## AP Exam Tip

> If a question asks whether something is a pure substance or a mixture, focus on **whether the composition is fixed or variable**, not whether it looks uniform.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Matter** has mass and occupies space
- **Pure substances** have fixed composition
- **Elements** contain one type of atom
- **Compounds** have constant elemental ratios
- **Mixtures** have variable composition and are physically separable

---

> Chemistry starts with classification. If you define matter correctly, everything else builds cleanly on top of it.

# Periodic Trends

## What are Periodic Trends?

**Periodic trends** are patterns in element properties observed across the **periodic table**. These patterns arise from **atomic structure**, particularly **nuclear charge, electron shielding, and electron configuration**.

Analogy: Imagine a neighborhood of houses (atoms). Some houses are bigger, some are smaller, and some hold onto their “belongings” (electrons) more tightly. These patterns repeat predictably as you move across streets (periods) and avenues (groups).

Understanding periodic trends helps predict **atomic size, ionization energy, electronegativity, and reactivity**—core concepts on the AP Chemistry exam.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Atomic Radius

**Atomic radius** is the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron.

Trends:

- **Across a period (left → right):** radius decreases

  - Nuclear charge increases
  - Electrons are added to the same energy level
  - Greater attraction pulls electrons closer

- **Down a group (top → bottom):** radius increases
  - Electrons occupy higher energy levels
  - Shielding reduces nuclear attraction

> Smaller atoms hold electrons more tightly.

---

### 2. Ionization Energy (IE)

**Ionization energy** = energy required to remove one electron from a neutral atom.

Trends:

- **Across a period:** IE increases
  - Higher nuclear charge → stronger electron attraction
- **Down a group:** IE decreases
  - Outer electrons are farther from the nucleus

> Low ionization energy → more reactive metals  
> High ionization energy → more reactive nonmetals

---

### 3. Electronegativity

**Electronegativity** = tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond.

Trends:

- **Across a period:** increases
- **Down a group:** decreases

> Fluorine has the highest electronegativity; cesium has one of the lowest.

---

### 4. Electron Affinity (EA)

**Electron affinity** = energy change when an atom gains an electron.

Trends:

- **Across a period:** generally becomes more negative (releases energy)
- **Down a group:** less negative (harder to gain electrons)

> High negative EA → atom readily accepts electrons.

---

### 5. Shielding and Effective Nuclear Charge

- **Shielding:** inner electrons block outer electrons from full nuclear charge
- **Effective nuclear charge (Z_eff):** net positive charge experienced by valence electrons

> Trends in radius, IE, and electronegativity are explained by Z_eff.

---

## Formulas & Calculations

### Effective Nuclear Charge

$$
Z_\text{eff} = Z - S
$$

Where:

- $Z$ = atomic number (total protons)
- $S$ = number of shielding electrons

Example: For sodium (Na), valence electron experiences:

$$
Z_\text{eff} = 11 - 10 = +1
$$

---

### Ionization Energy Approximation

Ionization energy is roughly proportional to Coulombic attraction:

$$
IE \propto \frac{Z_\text{eff}}{r^2}
$$

Where $r$ = distance of electron from nucleus.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Predicting Atomic Size

Which is larger: Na or Cl?

- Na: 11 protons, 1 valence electron
- Cl: 17 protons, 7 valence electrons

> Cl has higher Z_eff → electrons pulled closer → **Cl is smaller**.

---

### Example 2: Comparing Ionization Energy

Which requires more energy to remove the first electron: O or S?

- O: smaller radius, electrons closer to nucleus → higher IE
- S: larger radius, more shielding → lower IE

✔ Trend matches **across periods and down groups**.

---

### Example 3: Electronegativity Trend

Arrange: F, Li, O, Cs in order of **increasing electronegativity**:

- Cs < Li < O < F

> Moves left → right across a period and top → bottom in a group.

## Why It Matters

Periodic trends are foundational for:

- Predicting **reactivity**
- Understanding **bonding and polarity**
- Explaining **atomic size differences**
- Explaining **ion formation**
- Interpreting **chemical reactions and mechanisms**

> Trends link atomic structure to observable chemical behavior.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming trends move diagonally (instead of strictly across periods or down groups)
- Confusing radius with ionic radius (cations < neutral, anions > neutral)
- Forgetting that shielding affects trends
- Mixing up electronegativity and electron affinity
- Ignoring exceptions in **d- and f-block elements**

---

## AP Exam Tip

> Always justify trends using **effective nuclear charge, shielding, and distance from nucleus** rather than memorization. Show reasoning, not just the pattern.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Atomic radius:** decreases across periods, increases down groups
- **Ionization energy:** increases across periods, decreases down groups
- **Electronegativity:** increases across periods, decreases down groups
- **Electron affinity:** more negative across periods, less negative down groups
- Trends are explained by **Z_eff and shielding**

# Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds

---

## What are Valence Electrons and Ionic Compounds?

**Valence electrons** are the electrons in the outermost energy level of an atom. They determine **how an atom interacts with other atoms**—especially how it forms bonds.

**Ionic compounds** are formed when atoms **transfer electrons** to achieve a full outer shell, creating **positively and negatively charged ions** that stick together due to **electrostatic attraction**.

Analogy: Think of valence electrons as “loose items” in a backpack. Atoms want a **full backpack**. Metals tend to give items away, nonmetals tend to take items, and the resulting attraction between donors and receivers holds them together—this is how **ionic compounds** form.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Valence Electrons

- Found in the **highest occupied energy level** ($n$)
- Determine **chemical reactivity**
- Can be predicted from **group number** on the periodic table:

| Group | Valence Electrons |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 1A    | 1                 |
| 2A    | 2                 |
| 13A   | 3                 |
| 14A   | 4                 |
| 15A   | 5                 |
| 16A   | 6                 |
| 17A   | 7                 |
| 18A   | 8 (except He = 2) |

> Atoms gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a **full valence shell** (octet rule).

### 2. Ionic Bonding

- **Metals** lose valence electrons → form **cations** ($\ce{Na^+}$, $\ce{Ca^{2+}}$)
- **Nonmetals** gain electrons → form **anions** ($\ce{Cl^-}$, $\ce{O^{2-}}$)
- Opposite charges attract → form **ionic compounds**

Key properties of ionic compounds:

- High melting and boiling points
- Solid at room temperature
- Conduct electricity when dissolved in water
- Form crystalline lattice structures

> Ionic compounds are held together by **strong electrostatic forces**.

### 3. Determining Ionic Formulas

1. Write the **cation first**, then the anion.
2. Balance total positive and negative charges.
3. Use subscripts to indicate the number of ions.

Example: Aluminum ion ($\ce{Al^{3+}}$) + Oxygen ion ($\ce{O^{2-}}$) → formula?

- Find LCM of charges: 3 and 2 → 6
- Multiply ions to balance: 2 Al³⁺ + 3 O²⁻ → $\ce{Al2O3}$

---

## Formulas & Calculations

### Ionic Charge Balance

$$
\text{total positive charge} = \text{total negative charge}
$$

Example:

$$
\ce{Mg^{2+} + Cl^- → MgCl2}
$$

- Mg²⁺ needs 2 Cl⁻ ions to balance charge → formula is $\ce{MgCl2}$

---

### Electron Transfer (Valence Electrons)

$$
\ce{Na (1 valence e^-) → Na^+ + e^-}
$$

$$
\ce{Cl (7 valence e^-) + e^- → Cl^-}
$$

> This shows electron transfer leading to ionic bond formation.

## Examples

### Example 1: Sodium Chloride

- Na has 1 valence electron → loses 1 → $\ce{Na^+}$
- Cl has 7 valence electrons → gains 1 → $\ce{Cl^-}$
- Combine to form neutral compound → $\ce{NaCl}$

---

### Example 2: Magnesium Oxide

- Mg → 2 valence electrons → $\ce{Mg^{2+}}$
- O → 6 valence electrons → gains 2 → $\ce{O^{2-}}$
- Combine 1:1 → $\ce{MgO}$

---

### Example 3: Aluminum Oxide

- Al → 3 valence electrons → $\ce{Al^{3+}}$
- O → 6 valence electrons → gains 2 → $\ce{O^{2-}}$
- Balance charges: 2 Al³⁺ + 3 O²⁻ → $\ce{Al2O3}$

## Why It Matters

Valence electrons and ionic bonding are essential because they explain:

- How atoms **achieve stability** (octet rule)
- Formation of **salts and minerals**
- **Electrical conductivity** of ionic solutions
- **Chemical reactions** between metals and nonmetals

> Without understanding valence electrons, you cannot predict bonding patterns or compound formulas.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to balance total charges when writing formulas
- Confusing cations and anions in the formula
- Ignoring the number of valence electrons
- Thinking electrons are shared in ionic compounds (they are transferred)
- Writing subscripts incorrectly for polyatomic ions

---

## AP Exam Tip

> Always start by counting **valence electrons** to determine which atom loses or gains electrons. Use charge balance to write the correct ionic formula—this shows clear reasoning on the exam.

## Key Takeaways

- **Valence electrons** control chemical reactivity
- Metals form **cations**, nonmetals form **anions**
- Ionic compounds form by **electron transfer** and charge attraction
- Total positive and negative charges must **balance**
- Ionic compounds have characteristic **high melting points and crystalline structures**

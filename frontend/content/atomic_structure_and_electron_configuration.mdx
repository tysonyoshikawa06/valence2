# Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration

## What is Atomic Structure and Electron Configuration?

**Atomic structure** describes how an atom is organized—its nucleus and electrons—while **electron configuration** explains how electrons are arranged around the nucleus.

Think of an atom like a stadium. The **nucleus** is the center stage, packed with mass and positive charge, and the **electrons** sit in specific seating sections (energy levels and orbitals). Where the electrons sit determines how the atom behaves chemically.

Understanding atomic structure and electron configuration is essential for explaining **periodic trends, bonding, reactivity, and spectroscopy**—core ideas throughout AP Chemistry.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Subatomic Particles and the Atom

Atoms are made of three main particles:

- **Protons**: positive charge, located in the nucleus
- **Neutrons**: no charge, located in the nucleus
- **Electrons**: negative charge, located outside the nucleus

Key relationships:

- Atomic number = number of **protons**
- Mass number = protons + neutrons
- Neutral atom: protons = electrons

> The nucleus contains nearly all the mass, but electrons control chemistry.

### 2. Energy Levels, Sublevels, and Orbitals

Electrons do not move randomly. They occupy regions of space called **orbitals**, which have specific energies.

#### Energy Levels

- Labeled $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$
- Higher $n$ = higher energy and farther from the nucleus

#### Sublevels

Each energy level contains sublevels:

- **s, p, d, f**

#### Orbitals

Each sublevel contains orbitals:

- s: 1 orbital (2 electrons)
- p: 3 orbitals (6 electrons)
- d: 5 orbitals (10 electrons)
- f: 7 orbitals (14 electrons)

### 3. Rules for Electron Configuration

Electron configurations follow three fundamental principles:

#### Aufbau Principle

Electrons fill **lowest energy orbitals first**.

Energy order:

$$
1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s \dots
$$

---

#### Pauli Exclusion Principle

- Each orbital holds **at most 2 electrons**
- Electrons in the same orbital must have **opposite spins**

---

#### Hund’s Rule

- Electrons fill orbitals **singly before pairing**
- Minimizes electron–electron repulsion

> Spread out before pairing up.

## Formulas & Calculations

### Maximum Electrons in an Energy Level

$$
\text{max electrons} = 2n²
$$

Example:

- $n = 2$ → $2(2²) = 8$ electrons

---

### Total Electrons from Electron Configuration

For a neutral atom:

$$
\text{electrons} = \text{atomic number}
$$

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Writing an Electron Configuration (Oxygen)

Oxygen has atomic number 8 → 8 electrons.

Fill orbitals in order:

$$
1s²\ 2s²\ 2p⁴
$$

✔ Correct configuration for oxygen.

---

### Example 2: Orbital Diagram for Nitrogen

Nitrogen has 7 electrons:

$$
1s²\ 2s²\ 2p³
$$

According to Hund’s Rule:

- Each of the three 2p orbitals gets **one electron** before pairing

✔ Explains why nitrogen has three unpaired electrons.

---

### Example 3: Valence Electrons and Reactivity

Sodium (Na):

$$
1s²\ 2s²\ 2p⁶\ 3s¹
$$

- Valence electrons = electrons in the highest $n$ level
- Sodium has **1 valence electron**

> Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable configuration.

## Why It Matters

Atomic structure and electron configuration explain:

- Periodic trends (atomic radius, ionization energy)
- Chemical bonding
- Reactivity of elements
- Formation of ions
- Spectral lines and atomic emission

Electron configuration is the **link between atomic theory and observable chemical behavior**.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Filling orbitals out of order
- Pairing electrons before orbitals are singly filled
- Confusing orbitals with energy levels
- Forgetting that 4s fills before 3d
- Counting core electrons as valence electrons

---

## AP Exam Tip

> When predicting reactivity or trends, always reference **valence electrons and electron configuration**, not just the element’s position on the periodic table.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons
- Electrons occupy quantized energy levels and orbitals
- Electron configuration follows Aufbau, Pauli, and Hund’s rules
- Valence electrons control chemical behavior
- Atomic structure explains periodic trends and bonding

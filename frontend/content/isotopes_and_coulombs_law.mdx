# Isotopes and Coulomb’s Law

## What is Isotopes and Coulomb’s Law?

**Isotopes** are atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.  
**Coulomb’s Law** explains how charged particles attract or repel each other based on their charges and the distance between them.

A helpful analogy: imagine bowling balls (nuclei) with magnets inside and ping-pong balls (electrons) orbiting around them. Changing the number of neutrons changes the _weight_ of the bowling ball (isotopes), while Coulomb’s Law explains how strongly the magnets pull the ping-pong balls inward.

These ideas work together to explain **atomic mass, mass spectra, nuclear charge, and periodic trends**, all of which are heavily tested on the AP Chemistry exam.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Isotopes and Atomic Identity

An element is defined by its number of **protons** (atomic number).

- **Protons** → determine the element
- **Neutrons** → change the mass (isotopes)
- **Electrons** → determine chemical behavior

Example: Hydrogen

- H-1: 1 proton, 0 neutrons
- H-2 (deuterium): 1 proton, 1 neutron
- H-3 (tritium): 1 proton, 2 neutrons

> Isotopes of an element have nearly identical chemical properties but different masses.

---

### 2. Atomic Mass Is a Weighted Average

The **atomic mass** listed on the periodic table is not the mass of a single atom. It is a **weighted average** of all naturally occurring isotopes of that element.

This average depends on:

- The mass of each isotope
- The **relative abundance** of each isotope

Heavier isotopes only affect atomic mass significantly if they are common.

---

### 3. Mass Spectra of Elements

A **mass spectrum** is a graph produced by a mass spectrometer that shows:

- The **mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)** on the x-axis
- The **relative abundance** on the y-axis

Each peak corresponds to an isotope of the element.

Key ideas:

- Taller peak → more abundant isotope
- Peak position → isotope mass
- Atomic mass can be calculated directly from the spectrum

> Mass spectrometry is experimental evidence that isotopes exist.

### 4. Coulomb’s Law and Electrostatic Attraction

**Coulomb’s Law** describes the force between charged particles:

- Positive and negative charges attract
- Like charges repel
- Force depends on charge magnitude and distance

In atoms, Coulomb’s Law explains the attraction between:

- Positively charged **nucleus**
- Negatively charged **electrons**

This attraction controls atomic size, ion formation, and energy trends.

## Formulas & Calculations

### Coulomb’s Law

$$
F = k \frac{q₁q₂}{r²}
$$

Where:

- $F$ = electrostatic force
- $k$ = Coulomb’s constant ($8.99 \times 10⁹$ N·m²/C²)
- $q₁$, $q₂$ = charges
- $r$ = distance between charges

---

### Average Atomic Mass

$$
\text{atomic mass} = \sum (\text{isotope mass} \times \text{fractional abundance})
$$

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Using a Mass Spectrum to Find Atomic Mass

An element has two peaks in its mass spectrum:

- Mass = 10 amu, abundance = 20%
- Mass = 11 amu, abundance = 80%

**Step 1: Convert percentages to decimals**

- 20% → 0.20
- 80% → 0.80

**Step 2: Multiply and add**

$$
(10 \times 0.20) + (11 \times 0.80)
$$

$$
= 2.0 + 8.8 = 10.8 \text{ amu}
$$

✔ The atomic mass of the element is **10.8 amu**.

---

### Example 2: Calculating Atomic Mass from Isotope Data

Magnesium has three isotopes:

- Mg-24: 23.99 amu, 79%
- Mg-25: 24.99 amu, 10%
- Mg-26: 25.98 amu, 11%

$$
(23.99 \times 0.79) + (24.99 \times 0.10) + (25.98 \times 0.11)
$$

$$
= 18.95 + 2.50 + 2.86 = 24.31 \text{ amu}
$$

✔ Matches magnesium’s atomic mass on the periodic table.

---

### Example 3: Applying Coulomb’s Law to Atomic Trends

Which atom has a stronger attraction between its nucleus and valence electrons: **Mg** or **Al**?

- Mg: 12 protons
- Al: 13 protons
- Similar electron distance

Because $q$ is larger for aluminum, Coulomb’s Law predicts:

> Greater nuclear charge → stronger attraction

✔ Aluminum holds its electrons more tightly.

## Why It Matters

Isotopes and Coulomb’s Law explain many core chemistry ideas:

- Why atomic masses are **not whole numbers**
- How **mass spectra** provide experimental data
- Why atomic radius decreases across a period
- Why ionization energy increases across a period
- How nuclear charge affects electron behavior

Coulomb’s Law provides the **physical explanation** behind periodic trends, while isotopes explain **mass variation and nuclear stability**.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing **mass number** with **atomic mass**
- Forgetting to convert percent abundance to decimals
- Assuming the tallest mass spectrum peak is always the atomic mass
- Ignoring distance ($r²$) in Coulomb’s Law
- Thinking isotopes have different chemical properties

---

## AP Exam Tip

> When explaining trends like atomic radius or ionization energy, explicitly mention **Coulomb’s Law and increasing nuclear charge**. The AP exam rewards explanations, not memorization.

---

## Key Takeaways

- **Isotopes** differ in neutrons, not protons
- Atomic mass is a **weighted average**
- **Mass spectra** show isotope masses and abundances
- Coulomb’s Law governs attraction between nucleus and electrons
- Stronger nuclear charge means tighter electron binding

---

> If you understand forces and averages, atomic structure stops being memorization and starts making sense.

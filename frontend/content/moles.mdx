# Moles

## What Is a Mole?

In chemistry, a **mole** is a way to **count particles**, similar to how a dozen represents 12 items.

- **1 mole = 6.022 × 10²³ particles**
- This value is known as **Avogadro's number**

Because atoms and molecules are extremely small, chemists use the mole as a practical counting unit.

> A mole is to atoms what a dozen is to eggs — just much larger.

## What Counts as a "Particle"?

The word _particle_ depends on the substance involved:

- **Atoms** (e.g., 1 mol of He atoms)
- **Molecules** (e.g., 1 mol of H₂O molecules)
- **Formula units** (e.g., 1 mol of NaCl units)

Always read the problem carefully to determine _what_ is being counted.

## Moles and Molar Mass

The **molar mass** of a substance is the mass of **1 mole** of that substance.

- Units: **grams per mole (g/mol)**
- Numerically equal to the atomic or molecular mass on the periodic table

### Examples

- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Oxygen gas (O₂): 32.00 g/mol
- Water (H₂O): 18.02 g/mol

This means:

- 1 mol of H₂O has a mass of **18.02 g**
- 2 mol of H₂O has a mass of **36.04 g**

## Converting Between Moles and Grams

These conversions are essential for success in AP Chemistry.

### Grams → Moles

$$
\text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass (g)}}{\text{molar mass (g/mol)}}
$$

### Moles → Grams

$$
\text{mass (g)} = \text{moles} \times \text{molar mass (g/mol)}
$$

### Example

How many moles are in 36 g of water?

$$
\frac{36\text{ g}}{18\text{ g/mol}} = 2\text{ mol}
$$

## Converting Between Moles and Particles

Avogadro's number allows conversion between moles and particles.

### Moles → Particles

$$
\text{particles} = \text{moles} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23}
$$

### Particles → Moles

$$
\text{moles} = \frac{\text{particles}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}}
$$

### Example

How many molecules are in 0.5 mol of CO₂?

$$
0.5 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 3.01 \times 10^{23}\text{ molecules}
$$

## Why Moles Matter

Moles allow chemists to:

- Relate **mass** to **number of particles**
- Predict amounts of products and reactants
- Compare quantities of different substances fairly

Every major topic in AP Chemistry — **stoichiometry, gases, solutions, equilibrium** — relies on moles.

> Once you understand moles, chemistry becomes mathematical rather than mysterious.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Forgetting to use **molar mass**
- Confusing **atoms** with **molecules**
- Dropping units during calculations
- Not reading what the question is actually asking

Always track your **units** — they guide you to the correct setup.

## AP Exam Tip

If a problem involves:

- Mass
- Particles
- Chemical equations

👉 **Start by finding moles.**  
Moles are the bridge between all other quantities.

# Moles

Moles are small mammals that live underground and are known for their digging abilities.

## Physical Characteristics

Moles have several distinctive features:

- **Velvet-like fur** that can lay in any direction, helping them move backward and forward in tunnels
- **Powerful forelimbs** with large paws adapted for digging
- **Small eyes** and poor eyesight, as they spend most of their time underground
- **Sensitive snouts** that help them detect prey and navigate

## Habitat

Moles create extensive **tunnel systems** underground where they:

1. Hunt for food (primarily earthworms and insects)
2. Raise their young
3. Store food for later consumption

## Interesting Facts

> Moles can dig up to 18 feet of tunnel in just one hour!

A single mole can eat up to 70-100% of its body weight in food each day due to their high metabolism.

## Diet

Their primary diet consists of:

- Earthworms
- Insect larvae
- Small invertebrates
